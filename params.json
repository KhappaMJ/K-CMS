My name is MJ Khappa and I am a musician and filmaker.\r\n\r\n**The reason why I opened this community.**\r\nLast year I needed to get a new good responsive, light, modern flat website platform. I tried many solutions but as always, CMS are free and plugins or other portions of the website are for sale, beta or incompleted.\r\nSo I decided, in collaboration with a colleague, to develope my new website engine just by ourselves and now we have a new flat, responsive CMS without database and especially extremely dynamic.\r\n\r\n**What is K-CMS**\r\nK-CMS is basically the engine below my website, but as you can see I personally need to have a blog, a community and also, hope soon, a e-commerce platform. That's why I wanted to develop a fully-responsive mobile-friendly platform. This is the origin of the K-CMS project.\r\n\r\n**Sharing**\r\nEven if it requires some development yet my new website is working already and now we wanna share our code (Beta release) with all of you hoping that someone may find it useful and interesting.\r\nWe know you can find some bugs in the code, but we are keep working on it, improving and implementing new functions, consider this: K-CMS is my internet site!\r\n\r\nSo please, just take a look at our code (installation instructions are inside the rar file), we are pleasure to start some collaborations with you in developing K-CMS platform.\r\n\r\n\r\nThank you very much in advance,\r\nhope to talk to you soon\r\nKhappa MJ",
